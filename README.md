# Home Assistant Resources

Publicly-accessible resources for Home Assistant,
which may provide value to other members of the community.

All resources are heavily documented and commented,
in an effort to keep this README simple and reduce redundancy.
The [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) and tagged version numbers should be used to adopt specific changes and control behavior.
If you reference `main`, things might change out from under you!
